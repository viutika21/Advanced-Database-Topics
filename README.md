**Project Overview**
This research paper explores the integration of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in education to address the educational disparities faced by Indigenous students in Canada \cite{r1}. It proposes a management system utilizing a NoSQL-MongoDB database and logistic regression model to predict student dropout rates based on key factors such as Cultural Identity, Gender, Government Funding, and more \cite{r2}. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy rate of 0.831 on the testing dataset and provided valuable insights into the factors influencing dropout rates among Indigenous students. The paper emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity, ethical considerations, and collaboration with Indigenous communities throughout the research process. While logistic regression offers interpretability and simplicity, future work may explore the use of other machine learning models and qualitative data to enhance accuracy and gain deeper insights. The goal is to promote educational equity and inclusivity while respecting Indigenous knowledge and aspirations in Canadian education.
